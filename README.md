# Prework Study Guide

## Description

This purpose of this project was to create a space where I can store helpful notes as I advance my knowledge of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
By creating this website following the Git workflow, I not only have created a study guide, which I can frequently refer to, but also gained a further understanding of GitHub
and the workflow used to collaboratively code in the process.

## Usage

Using this study guide is as simple as finding the topic you would like to study/refer to and reading the associated notes. If you're not sure what you want to focus your studying on, you can open your browser's console for a suggestion. You can access the console by opening the developer tools in the settings menu or by using the shortcut Command+Option+I (on MacOS) or Control+Shift+I (on Windows). In the console, all the topics covered are displayed as well as a suggested topic to start your focus on.
